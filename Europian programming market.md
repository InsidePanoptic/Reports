# Europian programming market

We have made a small overview of the programming services market in Europe (software development and consulting). In the review, we have divided the markets into three categories: particularly large - with a turnover of more than 50 billion euros per year (Germany, UK, Ireland, France), and medium-sized - with a turnover between 15 and 50 billion euros per year (Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium and Poland) and small - with a market volume of less than 15 billion euro per year (all others). Here is a test version of a report analyzing two markets from the first group.

### Who will be useful to this report?

I'd like to say "all developers", but that's not the case. To be competitive you need to have a well-staffed team, basic processes, marketing tools created and the result of your previous work described. In addition, you must have a registered company that is ready to accept payment from clients.

First of all, the report will be useful for small and medium-sized teams that want to expand the geography of their services and thereby increase the turnover of their company at the expense of customers in new markets.
 
### The indicators we used in this report:
 
**Competition Ratio**, an experimental indicator developed by analysts at Panoptic Insights. It prepares for the market saturation of services in a given segment. It can take values from 0 to 10, where 1 is a free market and 10 is a saturated market. In a market, with a competitive coefficient of "1", you would have to spend half as much resources as in a market with a coefficient of "2" to achieve the same result. The coefficient can take a fractional value.
 
**The cost of attracting leads** is calculate based on data on the cost of interaction with content, conversions to the site and the average conversion in the selected segment of the market. The indicator is informative in nature, and the real value depends on other marketing activities of a specific company.
 
**Investment activity** shows the number of internal investments in business modernization. This indicator shows how much the company invested from its turnover, over the last year. In this case, the investment in automation tools, system integration and other software products (which can be created by external developers) is assessed. Hiring developers to staff the company is not considered an internal investment.
 
**Penetration of entrepreneurial activity**. An indicator actively used by the World Bank to describe the business environment in a region. It shows the percentage of a country's residents who are involved in entrepreneurship (nonemployment is also included in this list).  We have updated this indicator, clarifying, as we think, this indicator: we calculate the percentage of entrepreneurial activity among the economically active population. Be careful when using one of these indicators during planning.  

### Overview.
 
In Europe, more than 880K companies are economically active in the field of software products and IT consulting. That is 3.4% of all European companies. Their turnover is 742 billion euros. ($792 billion) per year. Since 2015, the market has grown by 27.7% and continues to grow even despite the pandemic and the war in the centre of Europe.
 
Average turnover of companies in the development segment: 839K euros per year. Which is 15.3% lower than the average turnover in Europe (which is 990K euros per year).
 
A total of 3.67 million people are employed in this segment (2.79% of the total employed population).
 
The four countries in the first group are: Germany (152.3 billion euros), the United Kingdom (126.6), Ireland (74.7), and France (73.3) occupy 57% of the European market in terms of company turnover.

### The UK.
 
The UK market is the most "saturated" among the markets of the first group. With the coefficient of congruence of 2.56 and the average turnover of companies at 763K euros per year (below the average in the chosen segment). Nevertheless, this market may be interesting with its low entry threshold: England is among the leading European countries with a high proportion of Internet penetration and a fairly high percentage of people engaged in business (indicator: the penetration of entrepreneurial activity). Such conditions were created thanks to the government's systematic work to support small businesses and startups (one example of an [existing program](https://tinyurl.com/qhwga75)).
 
Despite the high level of competition, this market is suitable for testing new business models, sales mechanics and value propositions.
 
Being in markets external to the UK, the development team can offer companies a competitive price, all other things being equal.

### France.
 
The French domestic market is interesting for the lowest cost of attracting a lead among the countries of the first four. The projected cost of starting a dialogue is estimated by our analysts at 72 euros (188 euros in England).
 
Since 2017, France has overtaken the UK in terms of inward investment and is in second place with a figure of 2.2 trillion euros. Companies are spending a lot of money on business modernization: process automation, integration into the global supply chain, accounting systems, etc. Considering all of the above, the French market is a great option for offering development services or IT consulting.
 
Low marketing budgets will generate a flow of business, which, judging by the huge investments in development, in recent years has been actively using the services of developers.
 
### Ireland.
 
The country stands out among the other markets of the first set with the lowest competitive coefficient, equal to 0.42 (with the European average in this segment - 1.85).
 
The domestic market of Ireland is very small - Irish companies are only 1.02% of all EU companies - and the main income of developers in this region is from the foreign market. In addition, the cost of attracting leads on the domestic market is the most expensive among the regions of the first bloc: 269 euros.
 
Ireland stands out against the background of other EU countries due to low taxes for companies in the IT segment (which include companies from this segment), and to consider this region makes sense only if you have a question of tax optimization, but to get profits outside.  
 
### Germany

The largest market in the first group (in terms of turnover and size of domestic investment) and not the most expensive in terms of attracting leads (prediction: 210 euros). The disadvantage of the German market is the lowest level of entrepreneurial activity in Europe: just over 4% of the economically active population are engaged in business (while the European average is 8%). At the same time, most of the business in Germany is a big business.
 
Deceptively low cost of attracting leads, most likely complicated by the long cycle of negotiations with numerous heads of departments of medium or large companies.
 
### Conclusion.
 
The described markets of the first block can be roughly divided in terms of strategy into two areas.
 
The first - is the [relatively] cheap testing of marketing hypotheses and advertising channels in Ireland and the UK the second - is the steady growth at the expense of corporate clients with a long cycle of negotiations (up to several months). The choice of the country depends on your development strategy and available resources.
