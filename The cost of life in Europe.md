# The cost of life in Europe

### Short review

The average salary in Europe according to Eurostat is €19736/year. At the same time, the average basic expenditure per adult is €15301 per year. An explanation of the basic expenditure indicator can be found [here](https://tinyurl.com/2ay2amop). 

This data will be useful for marketers and business owners when planning their marketing strategies. The amount of "free" money (money that remains after basic needs have been met) determines the psychology of consumer behaviour. 

For example. Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal are countries where the [average] basic spending is higher than the [average] national wage. Under such conditions, a large proportion of consumers in the market will tend to save money. When choosing a product/service in these regions, the price factor will be one of the most significant.

Understanding the psychology of customer behaviour in these markets determines the strategy for entering these markets: offering a discount or the possibility of instalments (possibly with a local bank as the partner) will help win the loyalty of your audience and generate revenue.

Another example of the use of this data would be in investment services. In "saturated" regions (where there is a significant amount of money left over after basic spending), people are more likely to invest in order to increase their capital.

Given that the source data includes information on the income of specific professions, we can make the marketing strategy of investment companies (pension funds, family offices, crowdfunding platforms, etc.) more effective.

It makes more sense to start with the German or UK markets where 600K+ developers have around €30K "leftover" by the end of the year than in Northern Macedonia where a few thousand developers have no more than €5K left over.

### The cost of living in Europe. 

The amount of money needed to live per adult in Europe varies greatly from region to region. 

Very cheap (below €10K per year) in the east of the region. 

Medium (10K to 20K euros) in the south and west (Greece, Serbia, Italy, Spain and Portugal). 

And high (above €20K) in central and northern Europe. 

At the same time, the two countries with the highest basic spending above 30K euros per year are Norway (35.1K) and Luxembourg (38.4K).

### Average salary

The average annual wage in the EU is 19,7K euros per year (here and after deducting all taxes). Denmark, Luxembourg and Norway have the highest average salaries in the region: more than 40K euros per year. 

The second group (average salary between 30K and 40K) includes Ireland (35.1K), Finland and France (32.4K), Sweden (32.2K), and Great Britain (31.2K). 

The third group (15-30K/year) is Belgium (29.5K), Germany (29.1K), Netherlands (27.1K), Spain (19.6K), Italy (18.7K), Cyprus and Slovenia (16.7K).

The remaining countries (less than 15K a year) classified in the fourth group are (apart from Portugal with 11K) in eastern Europe. In which only Estonia has an average wage above 10K.

### The quality of life.

Quality of life (percentage/amount of wages that go to pay for basic needs) is the conventional term used for this data set. It does not inform about the comfort level of an individual or the whole audience, but how much of a person's salary is spent to pay for basic needs. 

We measure this indicator in % of salary or thousands of euros.  

Turning to this indicator we can say that in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Cyprus the amount of basic spending (on average) is higher than the average wage. In Greece by as much as 24.2% or 2400 Euro/year in quantitative terms. 

The European average, on the other hand, is 78.5% or 4.4K euros.  

The 4 countries we would like to focus on are Denmark, France, Ireland and the UK. In these countries, the difference between the cost of living and the average salary is more than 10K euros per year. 15.7K, 12.1K, 11.2K and 10.2K respectively. 

### Quality of life and salary levels of developers. 

To illustrate the use of this dataset, the cheeses selected the salary level in the "Computer programming, consultancy and related activities" segment. This includes software developers, web developers and IT consultants. 

The average salary of employees in this segment is €31.7K per year (60.9% higher than the average European salary). It is paid to 3.5 million employed workers. 

The biggest gap between the salaries in this segment and the national average is observed in Bulgaria (211.9%), Romania (143.8%), Serbia (126.4%), the Czech Republic (111.1%) and Lithuania (100.5%). This is due to the low cost of living in these countries, which makes outsourcing and outstaffing developer services more competitive in central European markets. In total, there are 315K developers in these countries (8.8% of all employed developers in Europe). 

In general, developers in Europe belong to one of the most wealthy groups of the population. In most countries, the difference between the salary received and the cost of living exceeds 12k euros per year. Of the 31 countries in our report, only 13 countries did not get used to this threshold: all of Eastern Europe (except Estonia), Greece and Portugal.

The maximum difference is in Norway (38.7k euros per year), Ireland (33.7k) and Denmark (31.4k).
