# The cost of life in Europe

### Short review

The average salary in Europe according to Eurostat is €19736/year. At the same time, the average basic expenditure per adult is €15301 per year. An explanation of the basic expenditure indicator can be found [here](https://tinyurl.com/2ay2amop). 

This data will be useful for marketers and business owners when planning their marketing strategies. The amount of "free" money (money that remains after basic needs have been met) determines the psychology of consumer behaviour. 

For example. Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Portugal are countries where the [average] basic spending is higher than the [average] national wage. Under such conditions, a large proportion of consumers in the market will tend to save money. When choosing a product/service in these regions, the price factor will be one of the most significant.

Understanding the psychology of customer behaviour in these markets determines the strategy for entering these markets: offering a discount or the possibility of instalments (possibly with a local bank as the partner) will help win the loyalty of your audience and generate revenue.

Another example of the use of this data would be in investment services. In "saturated" regions (where there is a significant amount of money left over after basic spending), people are more likely to invest in order to increase their capital.

Given that the source data includes information on the income of specific professions, we can make the marketing strategy of investment companies (pension funds, family offices, crowdfunding platforms, etc.) more effective.

It makes more sense to start with the German or UK markets where 600K+ developers have around €30K "leftover" by the end of the year than in Northern Macedonia where a few thousand developers have no more than €5K left over.

Medium (10K to 20K euros) in the south and west (Greece, Serbia, Italy, Spain and Portugal). 

And high (above €20K) in central and northern Europe.
